Introduction
---
This is a hardware project for a DC motor driver. The final product should be an electronic printed circuit board (PCB) that is possible to make with hobbyist skills and resources. This PCB can be added to an appropriate controller and get some motors to run :)

Features
* can drive a DC motor in either direction with up to 14 Amperes of current and up to 52 Volts

What was done so far?
* started a project in CADSoft's Eagle (5.7.0 Light version)
* created a library for integrated circuit "DRV8432DKD" according to its datesheet
* started a schematics according to my skills and reference schematic from datasheet

Prerequisities to understand this
* understand what is transistor, RCL devices, PWM, H-bridge, DC motor, overcurrent

Prerequisities to be able to build
* skilled in PCB etching
* skilled in surface mount devices soldering

Prerequisities to be able to use this product
* have a controller with enough Input/Output ports (e.g. Launchpads MSP430, AVR, Arduino)
